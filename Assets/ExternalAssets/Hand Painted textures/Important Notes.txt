You may use, edit and do almost everything you need to adjust the textures for your projects!
Those normal maps are not ideal, but if you want to use them, feel free to use as you wish, but it is recomended to do your own maps!
Some of unity standard shaders also make those textures a bit "greyish", so it is another 
thing i will work on!
Thanks for purchasing the package! doing that you help me to get motivated do do more and more!
